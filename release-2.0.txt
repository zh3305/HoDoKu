
Release notes
=============

HoDoKu is a solver/generator/trainer/analyzer for standard sudoku. It is written in
Java/Swing and should therefore run on any platform supported by Java (tested
on Windows and Linux - Ubuntu/GTK+-LAF). Since it is written in Java the
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6 or higher must be installed on your computer
before you can run HoDoKu. The JRE am be downloaded from 
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.

Available languages: English and german

For all Windows versions hodoku.exe is the preferred program version. For all other
operating systems hodoku.jar has to be used. HoDoKu uses rather a lot of memory
(especially if you use the "Find all available steps"-feature). The recommended way
to run HoDoKu is:

	java -Xmx256m -jar hodoku.jar

Note: the parameter "-Xmx" is specific to the JRE provided by Sun. If you use a different
JRE, please look up the correct parameter for setting the maximum heap size at startup.
